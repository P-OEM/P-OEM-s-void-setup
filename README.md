## About this guide
* it is expected that the packages for ziping and unziping are installed before following the steps in this part of the void linux setup
* the terminal is not needed for this guide
* if you want to make a launcher, you can do the unzip part of this guide, then go to the [launcher](https://github.com/gamingtruble/gamingtruble-s-void-setup/tree/launcher) branch

## Download tarball
* to install discord on the void linux system, you can grab the tarball download from the official [discord website's](https://discord.com/download) download section

## Unzip
* now that the tarball is downloaded, I would recommend moving it to the home folder of your user (~). You can then unzip it either through the terminal (tar.gz), or by right clicking it and click on unzip in the menu.
* after the unziping, opening discord should be as easy as double clicking on the file in the folder simply named `Discord`

## Shortcut
* to make a discord shortcut press `Ctrl+Shift` then click and drag the icon for the `Discord` file to another location, and let go of the left mouse button
* wherever you droped the icon you dragged, a new shortcut for discord should appear
* note that this shortcut cannot be added to a panel, for that you need a launcher
