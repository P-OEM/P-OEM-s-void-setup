## Introduction
* it is expected that you have libreoffice packages installed before looking into these settings
* LibreOffice come with different packages for different tools, this page cover some of my preffered settings for tools I use whithin LibreOffice
    * it should be noted that the first "page" (base menu) in LibreOffice is special
        * it's like a canvas where all the other tools are layered on top of it, and it will let you access all the tools, and projects (it also shows recent projects by default)
            * like most windowed programs, LibreOffice have an `x` button in the top right corner for closing the program
                * whenever you open a tool like writer in LibreOffice, take note of the second `x` button under the first one, this will close the tool only, and bring you back to the first page
                    * knowing this will help you navigate

## Expected questions
* how do I read this?
    * title = tool or base menu page + settings (place you need to be)
    * expandable menu title = title of menu on tool or page
    * expandable menu dot titles = titles in menu you need to go to
    * dot titles with `=` something = setting and value you need to set
* why this?
    * good settings speed up work time
