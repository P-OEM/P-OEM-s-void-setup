## [Theme introduction](#introduction)

## Introduction
* the straight forward way of installing themes in the XFCE desktop environment is having the two folders `.icons` and `.themes` in your home directory (folder)
    * adding themes is usually as simple as unziping themes into the folders
    * the folder with the themes name should be located right under the folder

* a lot of themes can be found at [https://www.xfce-look.org](https://www.xfce-look.org/browse/)
* for a more comprehensive explanation, you can look to this xfce wiki [link](https://wiki.xfce.org/howto/install_new_themes)

* the part with my private themes and such are missing from this branch
