## About this guide
* it is expected that the packages for ziping and unziping are installed before following the steps in this part of the void linux setup
* vesktop is a custom discord app (in practice client), that I preffer, because it let you stream your screen with sound from your system
* the terminal is not needed for this guide
* if you want to make a launcher, you can do the unzip part of this guide, then go to the [launcher](https://github.com/P-OEM/P-OEM-s-void-setup/tree/launcher) branch

## Download tarball
* to install vesktop on the void linux system, you can grab the tarball download from the official [vesktop repository](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop?tab=readme-ov-file) under the download section
  * you'll find this under `amd64 / x86_64` heading, then then the `tarball` text that will download it once clicked
   * do this unless you use an `ARM` system, in that case look at the section under

## Unzip
* now that the tarball is downloaded, I would recommend moving it to the home folder of your user (~). You can then unzip it either through the terminal (tar.gz), or by right clicking it and click on unzip in the menu.
* after the unziping, opening vesktop should be as easy as double clicking on the file in the folder simply named `Vesktop`

## Shortcut
* to make a vesktop shortcut press `Ctrl+Shift` then click and drag the icon for the `Vesktop` file to another location, and let go of the left mouse button
* wherever you droped the icon you dragged, a new shortcut for vesktop should appear
* note that this shortcut cannot be added to a panel, for that you need a launcher
